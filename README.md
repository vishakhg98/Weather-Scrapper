## Bugs
Some icons missing for some uncommon weather events.
Weather condition name and link of icon automatically gets added to the missing_icons.txt in .\images\weather icons\missing_icons.txt
So please open an issue uploading missing_icons.txt file to fix those icons in future updates.
You can manually add that icons to ./images/weather icons folder yourself too to fix this bug.
